      Data Analysis
    </h1>
    <p>
      Digging insights out of your data is a two way street:
      you know your business,
      but you might not have the time or expertise
      to analyze the data.
      We have the tools, time, and expertise
      to analyze data,
      and the experience and maturity
      to understand your business needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all laugh at those big Internet companies
      that show us ads for a TV,
      <em>after</em> we buy a new TV.
      You can have all the "big data" analysis tools you want,
      but if you're not looking for the right thing,
      you won't get the right answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach is:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Listen to your business problems
      </li>
      <li>
        Collect your source data.
        This is often more challenging than it sounds.
        Your business systems store data in different ways.
        We're not afraid to get our hands dirty,
        and we'll work with you IT department to bring together
        the data without generating a lot of work
        for your already overworked IT department.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analyze the data.
        We'll show you correlations
        between significant business events and outcomes,
        so you can see if attendance at a marketing event leads to sales,
        or what causes you to lose customers.
        Often, analysis shows areas where data is missing.
        We'll find that data in other systems,
        or we can develop new applications for you,
        to capture the missing data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Present the data.
        The insights are useless unless the right people see them.
        We provide intuitive dashboards and reports
        accessible from a browser,
        and visible to authorized users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Insights often lead to more questions.
        We repeat the above,
        as long as you continue to get value from our services.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Our business models isn't based on selling you expensive "big data" tools.
      We start with the basic tools:
      databases, web applications, and virtual servers,
      so your costs and risks are low.
      We can scale the server and storage capacity as needed.
      If the data analysis requires something beyond
      what a typical database can do,
      we use open source tools like Solr,
      avoiding a big up-front commitment of money,
      and the attendant risk.
      If you have really do have big data,
      we can scale out with Hadoop, Zookeeper, and other tools
      for large scale map-reduce processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We handle the complexity and risk for you.
      You get the benefits of the insights.
