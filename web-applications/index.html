      Why Use a Web Application
    </h3>
    <p>
      A Web Application (often called a web app) uses a standard web browser, such as Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer, to
      implement a customer software application.  Since pretty well all computers are running browsers, and most users
      are comfortable using browsers - implementing a Web Application avoids the hassles associated with distributing and maintaining
      custom application to each user.  Web Applications are available to any user, any where in the world, as long as they
      are connected to the web.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web Applications are implemented within the Internet Server that it supplying content to the user's browser.  This
        means that the application logic is coded in one place - new releases are instantly available to all
        users with no action on their part.  Properly designed applications can be accessed with all popular browsers,
        and there is a further advantage in that the application can be accessed by users on completely different operating
        systems.
    </p>
    <p>
       Web Apps are particularly suited to database applications.  In these applications all users have access to the latest
       dataset and problems associated with data synchronization can be greatly simplified.

    <h3>
      We Can Help You Get Your Application On Line Quickly and Efficiently
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our experience has taught us that each Web Application project presents
      unique challenges.  Some Apps have well defined functionality, while others may
      need more function development.  Some Apps require working closely with users
      to develop a good human interface.  Some projects are looking for extra resources
      to work on an particular feature or enhancement, others prefer to outsource the
      entire development and operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first priority becomes understanding your challenge and proposing a way of working
      together to meet your objectives.  We like to break down our projects into
      managable pieces so that you can easily monitor the progress without feeling
      that you have been stuck in a morass of the big software project.  In cases where
      functionality is not well defined, we recommend starting with smaller, proof of
      concept projects, so that functions are well defined before committing to the
      higher costs of production releases.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use modern web development frameworks and languages, to give you applications
      that work the way your users expect them to. We automate the testing of the
      application (“test driven development”), so it’s easy to enhance the application,
      or fix bugs, with the confidence that the application still does everything it did
       before. We use continuous integration and continuous delivery, so you can see the
       progress we’re making, and so we’re ready to deploy enhancements as soon as you’re ready for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can take advantage of availability of cloud resources to house your application.  These
      resources are scaled to meet your requirements so that you can deploy your application
      efficiently, reliably and at a resonable cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can operate your application for you, or we can interface with your internal resouces
      so that you can run the application yourself.  When we are responsible for application operations,
      we deploy your application rapidly and easily through automated processes.  We monitor your
      application continuously and respond to problems, often before you even notice them. By
      leveraging computers to help us do our job, you get a stable, reliable application that's easy to enhance and fix.
